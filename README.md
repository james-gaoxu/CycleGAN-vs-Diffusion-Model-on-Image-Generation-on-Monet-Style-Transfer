The data contains all the necessary training images
CycleGAN_Monet.ipynb is the process of training CycleGAN, also is used to inference Monet style images. It also evaluate the FID score of the generated images. 
DB_Diffusion_Monet.ipynb has the import of the DB_Monet_Diffusion model from hugging face. For this implementation, you will need a hugging face token from: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

For both model, you will need to update the dataset location in the beginning of the dataset loading.
